# 1 Add a Background

(Step 1/3) To learn how to add a background to your game!

First, find or create an image that you want to use and download it to your computer.

##### 1. Upload an Image to Repl

1. Find the downloaded images. [Need help?](/tutorials/downloads/)
2. Open the asset folder in repl, click: `code > client > asset`
   ![repl asset](/images/replAsset)
3. Click and drag your files into this folder. Make sure your files are named something very easy and obvious (it is best to not use spaces or symbols), for example "zombies.png" or "shark.png". You will resize the images within the code, so don't worry if it seems to big or small right now.
