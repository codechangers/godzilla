# 7. Set up Co-op play
 (Step 1/4) To Set up multiplayer gameplay

##### 1.  In the `room.js` file, we'll change the speed in our `onMessage` _function_

```javascript
// File: code/client/src/game.js
// Copy 
const speed = player.speed;
// End Copy
/*[*/const speed = player.speed;/*]*/
```
Make sure that you don't add a new speed variable! just change the one that is already there.
