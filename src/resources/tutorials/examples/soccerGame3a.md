##### 1. Upload all of our character images ([Need Help?](/tutorials/images/)).

1. Find the downloaded images. [Need help?](/tutorials/downloads/)
2. Open the asset folder in repl, click: `code > client > asset`
<img src="/uploads/resources/repl-asset.png" max-width="200">
3. Click and drag your files into this folder. Make sure your files are named something very easy and obvious (it is best to not use spaces or symbols), for example "zombies.png" or "shark.png". You will resize the images within the code, so don't worry if it seems to big or small right now.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all of your characters are uplaoded into the Assets folder.
