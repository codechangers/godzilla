**2.** In the **Files** section of repl, Open the `imgs` folder.

**3.** Click and drag your file(s) into this folder.

![repl asset](/images/replImages)

> _Make sure your files are named something very easy and obvious (it is best to not use spaces or symbols), for example: "**zombies.png**" or "**shark.png**". You will resize the images within the code, so don't worry if it seems to big or small right now._
