# Fork your Repl!

##### 3) When you `fork` the project it keeps the same name. If you want to change the name of your project click on the name and change it to whatever you want (you can continue to change it at any time). Repl.it automatically saves, you don't need to constantly save your code.<br />

> **The new name saves automatically, just click outside of the pop up screen to get back into your code. You will see the name change at the top.
