# Add Images to your Game

##### Adding Images to your game

During the Pre Contest Course, we have provided a template in replit.com. The goal is to use our template to learn some basics about how we build games. At the end of the pre contest course you will have a basic game that will allow to have a main character that you are able to move around the screen.

We have provided two photos in the template, one for your game background, and one for your main character. Both images are located in the `imgs` folder. Later on this folder is where you will add all images.

At the end of the Pre Contest Course, you will have a basic game that has a main character that can be moved around the screen.
