## You can find one you like

You can use Google Images to search for an image, but **it must be a PNG image!** You can add "PNG" to your search and it should result in the right kind of images.

Once you find an image on Google Images that you want to use, you need to Right Click it and choose the "Save Image As..." option.

Then you need to name the image and save it to your desktop.

## Or create your own

# Uploading your image to repl

Now that you've found or designed your image, you need to finish them on your computer and drag + drop them into the assets folder within your repl project.

1. Find the downloaded images. [Need help?](/tutorials/downloads/)
2. Open the asset folder in repl, click on `img` folder.
3. Drag your files into this folder. Make sure your files are named something very easy and obvious (it is best to not use spaces or symbols), for example "zombies.png" or "shark.png". You will resize the images within the code, so don't worry if it seems to big or small right now.
