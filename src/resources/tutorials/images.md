# How to get an Image.
## You can find one you like
You can use Google Images to search for an image, but **it must be a PNG image!** You can add "PNG" to your search and it should result in the right kind of images.

Once you find an image on Google Images that you want to use, you need to Right Click it and choose the "Save Image As..." option.

<img src="/uploads/resources/saveimage.png" max-width="300">

Then you need to name the image and save it to your desktop.

## Or create your own
You can create your own images for _characters_, _resources_, or _items_ for your game by using one of the following online graphic design programs:
 - [pixilart.com](https://www.pixilart.com/)
 - [vectr.com](https://vectr.com/)

### Using pixilart.com
To save your art complete the following steps:
1. Click the download button at the top left of the screen.

2. Click on the Download .png,.gif
<img src="/uploads/resources/pa-pnggif.png" max-width="300">
3. Choose your image size (200x200 to 400x400 is a good range).
<img src="/uploads/resources/pa-size.png" max-width="300">
4. [Find your download](/tutorials/downloads/)

### Using vectr.com
1. To use Vectr click the "Use Online" button, and then create your image.
<img src="/uploads/resources/vctr-use.png" max-width="300">
2. Click the "Export" button in the top right corner.
<img src="/uploads/resources/vctr-export.png" max-width="300">
3. Change it to a png image in the right hand box.
<img src="/uploads/resources/vctr-png.png" max-width="300">
4. Change the pixel size (200-500 is suggested). If you created a background, make it so it can repeat easily and still use the same pixel size.
<img src="/uploads/resources/vctr-size.png" max-width="300">
5. Click the "Download" button.
<img src="/uploads/resources/vctr-download.png" max-width="300">
6. [Find your download](/tutorials/downloads/)

# Uploading your image to repl
Now that you've found or designed your image, you need to finish them on your computer and drag + drop them into the assets folder within your repl project.

1. Find the downloaded images. [Need help?](/tutorials/downloads/)
2. Open the asset folder in repl, click: `code > client > asset`
<img src="/uploads/resources/repl-asset.png" max-width="200">
3. Click and drag your files into this folder. Make sure your files are named something very easy and obvious (it is best to not use spaces or symbols), for example "zombies.png" or "shark.png". You will resize the images within the code, so don't worry if it seems to big or small right now.
